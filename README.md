# Audio output device switcher

## How it works

-   Copy script somewhere, I personally store it as `~/.scripts/pulseaudio-switcher/pulseaudio-switcher.sh`
-   Bind some handy shortcut, for example `Ctrl+Home`
-   Enjoy fast headphones/speakers switch

## Requirements

-   PulseAudio as audio interface
-   Optional, `libnotify-bin` to provide pretty notifications

## Credits

Idea was seen at [AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/4055/audio-output-device-fast-switch), then I personalized code and stored it here to be able to deploy it on new machines.
